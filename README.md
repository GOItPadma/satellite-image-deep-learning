# Techniques
This section explores the different deep and machine learning (ML) techniques applied to common problems in satellite imagery analysis. Good background reading is [Deep learning in remote sensing applications: A meta-analysis and review](https://www.iges.or.jp/en/publication_documents/pub/peer/en/6898/Ma+et+al+2019.pdf)

## Classification
Classification is the task of assigning a label to an image, e.g. this is an image of a forest. The more complex case is applying multiple labels to an image. This approach of image level classification is not to be confused with pixel-level classification which is called semantic segmentation.

## Segmentation
 Segmentation will assign a class label to each **pixel** in an image. Single class models are often trained for road or building segmentation, with multi class for land use/crop type classification. **Note** that many articles which refer to 'hyperspectral land classification' are actually describing semantic segmentation. Note that cloud detection can be addressed with semantic segmentation and has its own section [Cloud detection & removal](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning#cloud-detection--removal).

## Object detection
Onject detection is the task of placing a box around the bounds of an object (i.e. creating a bounding box). Typical use cases are detecting vehicles, aircraft & ships. A good introduction to the challenge of performing object detection on aerial imagery is given in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06042v2). In summary, images are large and objects may comprise only a few pixels, easily confused with random features in background. For the same reason, object detection datasets are inherently imbalanced, since the area of background typically dominates over the area of the objects to be detected. In general object detection performs well on large objects, and gets increasingly difficult as the objects get smaller & more densely packed. Model accuracy falls off rapidly as image resolution degrades, so it is common for object detection to use very high resolution imagery, e.g. 30cm RGB. A particular characteristic of aerial images is that objects can be oriented in any direction, so using rotated bounding boxes which align with the object can be crucial for extracting measurements of the length and width of an object.

## Super-resolution
Super-resolution attempts to enhance the resolution of an imaging system, and can be applied as a pre-processing step to improve the detection of small objects or boundaries. Its use is controversial since it can introduce artefacts at the same rate as real features. These techniques are generally grouped into single image super resolution (SISR) **or** a multi image super resolution (MISR)

## Few-shot learning
This is a class of techniques which attempt to make predictions for classes with few, one or even zero examples provided during training. In zero shot learning (ZSL) the model is assisted by the provision of auxiliary information which typically consists of descriptions/semantic attributes/word embeddings for both the seen and unseen classes at train time ([ref](https://learnopencv.com/zero-shot-learning-an-introduction/)). These approaches are particularly relevant to remote sensing, where there may be many examples of common classes, but few or even zero examples for other classes of interest.

## Self-supervised, unsupervised & contrastive learning
These techniques use unlabelled datasets. [Yann LeCun](https://braindump.jethro.dev/posts/lecun_cake_analogy/) has described self/unsupervised learning as the 'base of the cake': *If we think of our brain as a cake, then the cake base is unsupervised learning. The machine predicts any part of its input for any observed part, all without the use of labelled data. Supervised learning forms the icing on the cake, and reinforcement learning is the cherry on top.*

## Active learning
Supervised deep learning techniques typically require a huge number of annotated/labelled examples to provide a training dataset. However labelling at scale take significant time, expertise and resources. Active learning techniques aim to reduce the total amount of annotation that needs to be performed by selecting the most useful images to label from a large pool of unlabelled images, thus reducing the time to generate useful training datasets. These processes may be referred to as [Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning](https://medium.com/pytorch/https-medium-com-robert-munro-active-learning-with-pytorch-2f3ee8ebec)

## Image registration
Image registration is the process of registering one or more images onto another (typically well georeferenced) image. Traditionally this is performed manually by identifying control points (tie-points) in the images, for example using QGIS. This section lists approaches which mostly aim to automate this manual process. There is some overlap with the data fusion section but the distinction I make is that image registration is performed as a prerequisite to downstream processes which will use the registered data as an input.

## Synthetic data
Training data can be hard to acquire, particularly for rare events such as change detection after disasters, or imagery of rare classes of objects. In these situations, generating synthetic training data might be the only option. This has become quite sophisticated, with 3D models being use with open source games engines such as [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/).

# Annotation
For supervised machine learning, you will require annotated images. For example if you are performing object detection you will need to annotate images with bounding boxes. Check that your annotation tool of choice supports large image (likely geotiff) files, as not all will. Note that GeoJSON is widely used by remote sensing researchers but this annotation format is not commonly supported in general computer vision frameworks, and in practice you may have to convert the annotation format to use the data with your chosen framework. There are both closed and open source tools for creating and converting annotation formats. Some of these tools are simply for performing annotation, whilst others add features such as dataset management and versioning. Note that self-supervised and active learning approaches might circumvent the need to perform a large scale annotation exercise. Note that tiffs/geotiffs cannot be displayed by most browsers (Chrome), but CAN render in Safari.

# Training models
This section discusses training machine learning models.

# Metrics
A number of metrics are common to all model types (but can have slightly different meanings in contexts such as object detection), whilst other metrics are very specific to particular classes of model. The correct choice of metric is particularly critical for imbalanced dataset problems, e.g. object detection
* TP = true positive, FP = false positive, TN = true negative, FN = false negative
* `Precision` is the % of correct positive predictions, calculated as `precision = TP/(TP+FP)`
* `Recall` or **true positive rate** (TPR), is the % of true positives captured by the model, calculated as `recall = TP/(TP+FN)`. Note that FN is not possible in object detection, so recall is not appropriate.
* The `F1 score` (also called the F-score or the F-measure) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as `F1 = 2*(precision * recall)/(precision + recall)`. It conveys the balance between the precision and the recall. [Ref](https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-accuracy-is-not-enough-more-performance-measures-you-can-use/)
* The **false positive rate** (FPR), calculated as `FPR = FP/(FP+TN)` is often plotted against recall/TPR in an [ROC curve](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc) which shows how the TPR/FPR tradeoff varies with classification threshold. Lowering the classification threshold returns more true positives, but also more false positives. Note that since FN is not possible in object detection, ROC curves are not appropriate.
* Precision-vs-recall curves visualise the tradeoff between making false positives and false negatives
* [Accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification) is the most commonly used metric in 'real life' but can be a highly misleading metric for imbalanced data sets.
* `IoU` is an object detection specific metric, being the average intersect over union of prediction and ground truth bounding boxes for a given confidence threshold
* `mAP@0.5` is another object detection specific metric, being the mean value of the average precision for each class. `@0.5` sets a threshold for how much of the predicted bounding box overlaps the ground truth bounding box, i.e. "minimum 50% overlap"
* For more comprehensive definitions checkout [Object-Detection-Metrics](https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/Object-Detection-Metrics)

# ML best practice
This section includes tips and ideas I have picked up from other practitioners including [ai-fast-track](https://github.com/ai-fast-track), [FraPochetti](https://github.com/FraPochetti) & the IceVision community
* Almost all imagery data on the internet is in RGB format, and common techniques designed for working with this 3 band imagery may fail or need significant adaptation to work with multiband data (e.g. 13-band Sentinel 2)
* In general, classification and object detection models are created using transfer learning, where the majority of the weights are not updated in training but have been pre computed using standard vision datasets such as ImageNet
* Since satellite images are typically very large, it is common to tile them before processing. Alternatively checkout [Fully Convolutional Image Classification on Arbitrary Sized Image](https://learnopencv.com/fully-convolutional-image-classification-on-arbitrary-sized-image/) -> TLDR replace the fully-connected layer with a convolution-layer
* Where you have small sample sizes, e.g. for a small object class which may be under represented in your training dataset, use image augmentation
* In general, larger models will outperform smaller models, particularly on challenging tasks such as detecting small objetcs
* If model performance in unsatisfactory, try to increase your dataset size before switching to another model architecture
* In training, whenever possible increase the batch size, as small batch sizes produce poor normalization statistics
* The vast majority of the literature uses supervised learning with the requirement for large volumes of annotated data, which is a bottleneck to development and deployment. We are just starting to see self-supervised approaches applied to remote sensing data
* [4-ways-to-improve-class-imbalance](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-ways-to-improve-class-imbalance-for-image-data-9adec8f390f1) discusses the pros and cons of several rebalancing techniques, applied to an aerial dataset. Reason to read: models can reach an accuracy ceiling where majority classes are easily predicted but minority classes poorly predicted. Overall model accuracy may not improve until steps are taken to account for class imbalance.

# Free online compute
A GPU is required for training deep learning models (but not necessarily for inferencing), and this section lists a couple of free Jupyter environments with GPU available. There is a good overview of online Jupyter development environments [on the fastai site](https://course19.fast.ai). I personally use Colab Pro with data hosted on Google Drive, or Sagemaker if I have very long running training jobs.

## Google Colab
* Collaboratory [notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com) with GPU as a backend for free for 12 hours at a time. Note that the GPU may be shared with other users, so if you aren't getting good performance try reloading.
* Also a pro tier for $10 a month -> https://colab.research.google.com/signup
* Tensorflow, pytorch & fastai available but you may need to update them
* [Colab Alive](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colab-alive/eookkckfbbgnhdgcbfbicoahejkdoele?hl=en) is a chrome extension that keeps Colab notebooks alive.
* [colab-ssh](https://github.com/WassimBenzarti/colab-ssh) -> lets you ssh to a colab instance like it‚Äôs an EC2 machine and install packages that require full linux functionality

## Kaggle - also Google!
* Free to use
* GPU Kernels - may run for 1 hour
* Tensorflow, pytorch & fastai available but you may need to update them
* Advantage that many datasets are already available

## Others
* [Paperspace gradient](https://gradient.run/notebooks) -> free tier includes GPU usage
* [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) -> many features for collaboration, GPU use is paid <p align='right'>[<img src= "images/ToC_button.png" height='30'>](#table-of-contents)</p>

# Neural nets in space
Processing on board a satellite allows less data to be downlinked. e.g. super-resolution image might take 8 images to generate, then a single image is downlinked. Other applications include cloud detection and collision avoidance.
